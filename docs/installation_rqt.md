# Installing the `rqt` GUI tools

The `rqt` package provides a collection of tools for ROS 2 graphical user interface (GUI) development.
Everything done in rqt can be done on the command line, but rqt provides a more user-friendly way to manipulate ROS 2 elements.
To install the `rqt` package, open a new terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install '~ros-iron-rqt-*'
```
