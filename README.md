# Robotic Systems Course: ROS Module

Welcome to the Robotic Systems Course GitHub repository! This repository is designed to accompany the ROS module of the course SIE 496/596: Robotic Systems at the University of Arizona. 
The repo contains a collection of resources, examples, and documentation to support your learning experience with ROS.

## Note

‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is in development and will be updated regularly. 
Some of the content may be incomplete or subject to change.

## Repository Structure

- **`docs/`**: Contains markdown documentation to guide you through various topics in ROS.
  - `installation_guide.md`: Step-by-step instructions to set up ROS.
  <!-- - `ros_basics.md`: Basic concepts and usage of ROS.
  - `robot_simulation.md`: Guide on robot simulation using ROS.
  - `advanced_topics.md`: Advanced topics in ROS for further exploration. -->

- **`examples/`**: A collection of example projects demonstrated during the course.
  - `pub_sub_ws`: Example workspace containing a package with a publisher and subscriber node (like `talker` and `listener`).
  <!-- - `basic_ros_example/`: Basic example to get started with ROS.
  - `robot_arm_control/`: Example for controlling a robotic arm.
